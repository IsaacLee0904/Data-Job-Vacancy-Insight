# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this config, we tell dbt how to build the models, where to build them, which warehouse 
# to use, and what query tag to provide on the snowflake site. 
# These settings can be overridden in the individual model files
# using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

      materialized: table  # Typically, modeling layer models are materialized as tables
